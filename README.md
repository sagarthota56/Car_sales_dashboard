1.Selling Price vs. Year:

The line chart displays the trend in car selling prices from 1996 to 2020.
A notable outlier occurs in 2019, where the selling price spikes significantly. This suggests an unusual event or data anomaly in that year.

2.Kilometers Driven Distribution:

The bar chart represents the distribution of cars based on kilometers driven.
There are two prominent spikes, indicating that a significant number of cars fall within specific ranges of kilometers driven, potentially suggesting common usage levels or data anomalies.

3.Selling Price by Seller Type:

The horizontal bar chart breaks down selling prices by seller type: Individual, Dealer, and Trustmark Dealer.
Individuals and Dealers contribute the most to the selling price, with Individual sellers having the highest aggregate selling price. Trustmark Dealers contribute significantly less.
